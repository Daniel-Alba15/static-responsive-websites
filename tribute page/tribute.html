            <h1>Some information about him:</h1>

            <p>Turing imagined a hypothetical machine, (now called a 'Turing machine' that would read a tape of symbols,
                one at a time, then either rewrite or erase the symbol, before then shifting the tape to the left or
                right. In fact, originally Turing describes a person slavishly performing these operations. He called
                this person the 'computer'. Some Turing machines would run forever, some would halt quite quickly, and
                for others it depended on the input. Turing asked if some method existed that always allowed us to
                determine whether a computer program and input would eventually halt, or run forever. He proved that a
                general algorithm to solve this problem, for all possible program and input pairs, cannot exist - making
                it an example of an undecidable problem. An astounding example that disproved Hilbert's question on
                decidability. As it happens, Turing had been beaten to the punch. Unknown to him, the Princeton
                mathematician Alonzo Church had independently described an equivalent undecidable problem earlier in the
                year. Yet Turing's halting problem is regarded as the more intuitive and easier to understand.
                Subsequently, Alan went on to Princeton to study under Church where he gained his PhD. It was then,
                after returning to Cambridge, that Turing started working part time for the Government Code and Cypher
                School - the UK's code breakers. For many years, even before the Second World War, the German military
                had been using a cipher machine to encrypt their secret message, a machine called Enigma. The Enigma
                machine was about the size of a typewriter, except instead of having a carriage and paper like a normal
                typewriter it had a second set of letters that lit up; this was called the lampboard. Typing a message
                on the keyboard resulted in letters lighting up on the lampboard, so if you pressed 'A' on the keyboard,
                the letter 'H' might then light up on the lampboard - this was your code! The Enigma Machine was
                essentially a simple circuit, connecting a battery to a bulb. Pressing a key on the keyboard would
                complete a circuit, and illuminate a letter on the lampboard. The standard Enigma Machine had over 150
                million million million daily settings, but this is not why Enigma was so hard to break. Inside, Enigma
                contained three moving parts, called rotors. These rotors would turn after pressing a key, making the
                wires of the circuit rotate, thus changing the circuit completely. So if you now pressed 'A' for a
                second time it may not be the same letter as before. Double letters, for example, may not become double
                letters in the code. It was these rotors that made Enigma so difficult to break. A day after the UK
                declared war with Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park for work on breaking the German cipher.
                Turing's contribution to the effort at Bletchley Park was indispensible. Not only did he make the first
                breakthroughs with the Naval Enigma code, allowing Britain's food and supplies to be shipped across the
                Atlantic, but, along with Gordon Welchman, designed a machine to break Enigma. This code breaking
                machine was called the Bombe, a name chosen to honour the earlier Polish code breaking machine called
                Bomba. The Bombe worked using the mathematical principle of contradiction. Given an Enigma code, the
                code breakers would try and guess a short phrase, or 'crib', that might appear in the message. They
                would input this guess into the Bombe and, if this input did not result in a valid Enigma code, it would
                be rejected. However, if left to continue, all other deductions made by the Bombe Machine were then
                equally invalid, and so could all be rejected at once as fruit of the poison tree. On a good day, the
                Bombe machine could find the Enigma setting in 15 minutes. In 1945 Turing received an OBE for his work
                at Bletchley Park, even though the work remained top secret for another 30 years.</p>
